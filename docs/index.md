# A Programmer's Journey with Haskell

**Work in progress**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## Introduction

> **"Your mileage may vary"** *(common consumer warning)*

I'm a mainframe assembly language systems programmer, 
but as part of the job I've learned other languages to keep my hand in.

I have a program, *untod*, which has developed over the years, 
and which I use for a porting exercise whenever I want 
to learn a new language.

* [More about *untod*](aboutuntod.md)
* [More about me](aboutme.md)
* [A Rust starting point](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [A Haskell starting point](https://www.haskell.org/)

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
Having just come to the end of a contract, 
I decided to learn another language.
I had previously (2009) taken a quick look at Haskell 
and given up, mainly because I just couldn't get my head round the IO Monad.
I thought another try would be appropriate
(and, as it turned out, I was so right).

And so the journey begins: porting Untod from Rust to Haskell
(and adding a few features on the way).

## Getting started -- the Haskell environment
> **"To begin, at the beginning"** *(Dylan Thomas, Under Milk Wood)*

I had an old (2009) version of the Haskell Platform installed,
and thought it might be a good idea to bring it up-to-date. 
This took a number of steps:
