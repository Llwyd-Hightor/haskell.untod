# A Programmer's Journey with Haskell

**Work in progress**

## Introduction

I'm a mainframe assembly language systems programmer, 
but as part of the job I've learned other languages to keep my hand in.

I have a program, *untod*, which has developed over the years, 
and which I use for a porting exercise whenever I want 
to learn a new language.
