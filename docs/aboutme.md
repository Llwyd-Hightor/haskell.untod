# Who am I?

I'm Brent Longborough. 
I started work as an Assembler Language programmer
on the IBM/360 in November, 1967, 
and I've been doing that ever since, all the way up to System/Z.

But along the way I've always been interested in new tools, 
and in programming languages ever since university in 1962.

I couldn't really call myself a professional programmer 
in anything but Assembler,
but could, as a minimum, shake a stick at 
Rexx(?), APL, Perl(!), PHP(ยก), Ruby(?), Python(!), R(?) Go(!), Rust(!), 
and (I hope soon) Haskell
